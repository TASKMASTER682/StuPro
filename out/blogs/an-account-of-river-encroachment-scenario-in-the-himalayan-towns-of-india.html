like Nile, Amazon, and Indus. In many cultures including that of India, rivers were considered holy by the people and were protected. However, river encroachment has been rampant in recent times especially in urban and suburban regions. The culprit in chief is the unbridled and thoughtless urbanization of the river plains and valleys all alike with eyes firmly set to the monetary goals and without ever giving a second thought to the sustainability of the environment, resource management or the grim future that awaits us on this weary path. The most intensive interactions between human beings and the environment take place in cities and their peripheries (Raihan and Kaiser, 2012). The high rate of migration and increased population pressure have been the chief causes of this unplanned growth among many others. First Secretary in India&#x27;s Permanent Mission to the UN, <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/who-is-paulomi-tripathi-junior-diplomat-who-thrashed-pakistan-in-un-general-assembly/870881/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Paulomi Tripathi</a>, at the 51st Session Commission on Population and Development mentioned that more than half of the world&#x27;s population lives in urban areas now. By the year 2050, the figure is expected to cross a level of over two-thirds of the total. It has been the primary cause of the destruction of riverbanks ultimately leading to narrowing of rivers and in some cases obliteration of the tributaries to major rivers.</p><h2><strong>What is encroachment?</strong></h2><p><br/></p><p>Encroachment as per definition is a term used to describe the advancement of structures and utilities (roads, railroads, improved paths) and other development, into natural areas such as river corridors, floodplains, wetlands, lakes and ponds, and the buffers around these areas.</p><p><br/></p><p>The term also encompasses the removal of vegetation and the placement of fill, or an alteration of topography into such natural areas. Encroachment increases impervious cover adjacent to rivers, lakes, and wetlands, thus increasing the runoff rate and volume, temperature of the receiving water and loading of sediment and other pollutants thus impacting the functions and values of the natural areas, such as a decline in water quality, disruption of equilibrium conditions, loss of habitat (both aquatic and terrestrial), loss of flood attenuation, or reduction of ecological processes.. The cumulative loss of wetlands that provide water quality protection to adjacent surface waters can result in on-going reduction in water quality. The extent of encroachment, the cumulative effects of impervious cover, and the degree to which natural infiltration has been compromised can also contribute to the instability of the stream channel.</p><p><br/></p><p>The situation gets trickier when it comes to the hilly towns of Himalayas. The young mountain range of northern India is already prone to seismic activity, erosion, and landslides. As per a UNDP report, 70 % of population of India is at risk to floods and 60% is susceptible to earthquakes. The risk is higher in urban areas owing to density and overcrowding.</p><h3><strong>1.2 Impact of climate change</strong></h3><p><br/></p><p>The global climate change also affects and worsens the situation. Whole Himalayan range is vulnerable because of rising temperatures. Each valley—be it Kashmir, Kedarnath or Badrinath—faces the threat of increased precipitation. According to the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, global warming will lead to changes in the Himalayan region. There will be at least one extreme event in the Himalayas every year, as per the report. It can range from north-eastern India to Pakistan in the west. Some examples of such events already happening are floods in Pakistan and cloud bursts in Jammu and Kashmir. Most typical of the examples is that of Uttarakhand disaster branded by environmentalists as ‘Himalayan tsunami’. It is quite clear that the disaster was not simply a freak natural hazard but a result of unbridled development in the Land of the</p><p><br/></p><p>Gods. Activists say all of this could have been prevented if the state government had heeded the call to cease construction and encroachment on the riverbed.</p><p><br/></p><p>According to the Jammu and Kashmir State Action Plan on Climate Change, 2013, minimum temperatures in the Himalayan region are projected to rise by 1°C to 4.5°C. Maximum temperatures are expected to rise by 0.5°C to 2.5°C.

In many cultures including that of India, rivers were considered holy by the people and were protected. However, river encroachment has been rampant in recent times especially in urban and suburban regions. The culprit in chief is the unbridled and thoughtless urbanization of the river plains and valleys all alike with eyes firmly set to the monetary goals and without ever giving a second thought to the sustainability of the environment, resource management or the grim future that awaits us on this weary path. The most intensive interactions between human beings and the environment take place in cities and their peripheries (Raihan and Kaiser, 2012). The high rate of migration and increased population pressure have been the chief causes of this unplanned growth among many others. First Secretary in India's Permanent Mission to the UN, \u003ca href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/who-is-paulomi-tripathi-junior-diplomat-who-thrashed-pakistan-in-un-general-assembly/870881/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePaulomi Tripathi\u003c/a\u003e, at the 51st Session Commission on Population and Development mentioned that more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas now. By the year 2050, the figure is expected to cross a level of over two-thirds of the total. It has been the primary cause of the destruction of riverbanks ultimately leading to narrowing of rivers and in some cases obliteration of the tributaries to major rivers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is encroachment?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEncroachment as per definition is a term used to describe the advancement of structures and utilities (roads, railroads, improved paths) and other development, into natural areas such as river corridors, floodplains, wetlands, lakes and ponds, and the buffers around these areas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe term also encompasses the removal of vegetation and the placement of fill, or an alteration of topography into such natural areas. Encroachment increases impervious cover adjacent to rivers, lakes, and wetlands, thus increasing the runoff rate and volume, temperature of the receiving water and loading of sediment and other pollutants thus impacting the functions and values of the natural areas, such as a decline in water quality, disruption of equilibrium conditions, loss of habitat (both aquatic and terrestrial), loss of flood attenuation, or reduction of ecological processes.. The cumulative loss of wetlands that provide water quality protection to adjacent surface waters can result in on-going reduction in water quality. The extent of encroachment, the cumulative effects of impervious cover, and the degree to which natural infiltration has been compromised can also contribute to the instability of the stream channel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe situation gets trickier when it comes to the hilly towns of Himalayas. The young mountain range of northern India is already prone to seismic activity, erosion, and landslides. As per a UNDP report, 70 % of population of India is at risk to floods and 60% is susceptible to earthquakes. The risk is higher in urban areas owing to density and overcrowding.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1.2 Impact of climate change\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe global climate change also affects and worsens the situation. Whole Himalayan range is vulnerable because of rising temperatures. Each valley—be it Kashmir, Kedarnath or Badrinath—faces the threat of increased precipitation. According to the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, global warming will lead to changes in the Himalayan region. There will be at least one extreme event in the Himalayas every year, as per the report. It can range from north-eastern India to Pakistan in the west. Some examples of such events already happening are floods in Pakistan and cloud bursts in Jammu and Kashmir. Most typical of the examples is that of Uttarakhand disaster branded by environmentalists as ‘Himalayan tsunami’. It is quite clear that the disaster was not simply a freak natural hazard but a result of unbridled development in the Land of the\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGods.

Maximum temperatures are expected to rise by 0.5°C to 2.5°C. The report also mentions the number of rainy days may increase by 5 - 10 days on an average in the region by 2030s, with an increase of more than 15 days in the eastern part of the Jammu and Kashmir region.
